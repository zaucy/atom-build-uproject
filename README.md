# UProject (Unreal Engine 4) build system for Atom

Uses the [atom-build](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build) package to execute the [UE4](https://www.unrealengine.com) build system. It essentially runs the ue4 build batch files.

**Note:** Only gets detected when there is a `.uproject` file in the project root.

Currently only supports windows requires visual studio to be installed. **Pull requests welcome!**
